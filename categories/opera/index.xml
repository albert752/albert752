Tonight I witnessed one of the most magical opera nights of my life. The play was Cosi Fan Tutte, the third collaboration between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Lorenzo da Ponte. Let me tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m still in shock. The amount of joy, laughter, and overall positive feelings that I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced tonight was unprecedented.

To reach my final destination, Zarautz, I&amp;rsquo;m taking a bus that leaves in 30 minutes.</description></item></channel></rss>
