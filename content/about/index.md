# Introduction
I am a telecommunications engineer specialized in cybersecurity. I currently work as a Senior Consultant at Deloitte. I'm specialized in the security aspects of cloud environments such as AWS. My background is purely technical with a bachelor's degree in telecommunications, major in telematics, and a master's in cybersecurity. Other technical areas that I'm interested in and I have experience in are GNU/Linux systems administration, blockchain technologies, and web programming.

During my degree and master's, I was awarded honors in various subjects including the master's final thesis. Moreover, my bachelor's thesis was chosen as the best of 19-20 as well as received honors. Nowadays I am particularly interested in blockchain technologies and their disruptive capabilities.
