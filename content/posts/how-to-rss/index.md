# Introduction
Let's talk about RSS, shall we? I'm sure you've seen this icon milions of times and ask yourself, what social platfom is that? Well, it is not. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication and is a web feed based in XML that allows users to recive updates on their favourite websites. Let me put it in simple english: RSS is a standard way in wich users can get notified whenever a website is updates. This really comes in hancy with blogs such this ones but is also available for instance for youtube channels.

You may ask yourself, why on earth should I care about that? The youtube app pushes notifications and even some websites now send updates via the push notification system of the web browser. Well you should. In this article I wont explore the ins and outs of RSS since I want to keep it simple for a broather audience. Have you ever wondered the amount of notifications that are just distractions and not real information? Try to come up with a pie chart and you'll realize that the majority of the notifications are unwanted and unasked for. Moreover, if you decide to disable them, you would have to navigate through a mess of diferent configurations. RSS is simpler, you just tell the RSS reader what specific sources you want to be notified about, and the rest is magic! Let me show you how does it work.
