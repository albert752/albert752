I'm quitting Instagram. I'm sick and tired of wasting my precious time scrolling. I always thought of myself as someone above all of those issues that are often pointed out about social media. But the situation has reached a point where I can't take it anymore. The amount of hours that I'm pouring on the platform is increasing exponentially, so I quit.

I haven't talked about it yet, but I'm into analog photography. Instagram served as an outlet to display my pictures. Since I'm abandoning the platform for good, I'll share my journey here on my blog. I've created a section called [Gallery](https://albertazemar.com/gallery). There you'll find a selection of my favorite pictures. I'll be updating it as I develop more film rolls. I'm still not sure if I like the current format. I'm using [mfg92](https://github.com/mfg92) shortcode to create the gallery called hugo-shortcode-gallery. You can find it [here](https://github.com/mfg92/hugo-shortcode-gallery).

The image I selected as the cover for this post was taken in Sitges. It illustrates the beauty of analog photography. It might seem that it has been composed with some kind of computer software. But no, it's an anomaly, an error. This image is a double exposure with a peculiar filter in the middle created by the roll. A phenomenon that Bob Ross would define as a happy accident. I find in these exceptions the beauty of the format. The uncertainty, expectation, and thrill that you feel when you receive your developed rolls can't be matched by the digital world. 

This weekend, a friend of mine gave me a quick masterclass on manual photography. I use a restored Canon AE-1 Program. Its main feature is the automatic mode that turns your DSLR into a point-and-shoot. I had no prior experience in photography so I'd been using it since I bought the camera. I'm now trying to use the manual mode to experience even more the creative side of analog photography. I'll be documenting my experience and my learning process in manual mode here on my blog.

In the meantime, enjoy the new feature. I hope you have a wonderful end of the week!
