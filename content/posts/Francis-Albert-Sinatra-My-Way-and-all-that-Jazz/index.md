Francis Albert Sinatra or as commonly known as Frank Sinatra is, in my humble opinion, one of the best crooners that ever lived. His songs have healed my soul when I needed it the most, guided me while dealing with my feelings, and empowered me to make bold decisions in my life. Even though we never shared a time frame in our existence, I have to thank him for always being there for me. 

It was during the summer of 2019 that a dear friend of mine introduced me to Jazz. I already knew who Frank was. Who doesn't? I usually listened to some of his most beloved songs before. It wasn't until I dived into the intricate Jazz rabbit hole that I could appreciate the magic of his repertoire. The lyrics of his songs healed me, gave me hope for a brighter future, and by all means, made a significant impact on the person that I've become since then.

I'm fully aware that most of his tunes were not written by him and, My Way, my personal favorite, is one of them. Despite, you have to admit that sometimes the delivery of the message is as important as the message itself. Here is where Sinatra excels. His deep and rich voice reaches your soul and makes you feel every phrase of the lyrics. I felt so in love with My Way that I have these exact words tattoed on my forearm. For me is an anthem of independence and self-liberation. A song that speaks of taking matters into your own hands, listening to your inner self, and acting accordingly. In this life, you can lie to anyone but yourself. 

But My Way is not the end of this love story: Summer Wind, Come Fly With Me, The Best Is Yet To Come, Luck Be A Lady, Fly Me To The Moon, The Good Live, to name a few. And I could go on for a quite long list. There is something special in each of his songs that makes them little pieces of sweet candy for your delight. 

I will never get tired of him. Despite not listening to his records as often as I used to, they will always be there. When you need them the most, they will provide a comfortable atmosphere to ponder, relax and introspect. 

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
