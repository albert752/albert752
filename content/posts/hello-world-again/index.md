So my blog is back. I started this project in March 2020 during the lockdown as a fun way to learn a bit about Django, python's web app framework, and AWS (Amazon Web Services). I had some prior experience using Django from my first internship at NTT. If you are someone who has an interest in diving into this framework, I would strongly recommend CoreyMS [^1] video series on YouTube about it. It covers the basics needed, provided you have a good understanding of the python programming language.

Then, time went by and I left the project with only three posts (shame on me). Also, a year after, the AWS Free tier plan that I was using expired. So, after two painful +30â‚¬ bills, I decided to shut it down. I kept renewing the domain though just in case. Fun fact, I did use the running implementation of the old blog as the deliverable for a masters' degree subject. In teams, we had to develop a web app with security by design. So not wanting to socialize with the rest of my mates (long story short, two of them are now coworkers of mine and we get along pretty well), I asked the professor if it would be ok to use my blog as the deliverable. She said no problem and hey, it was graded with the maximum score so, not bad at all.

Lately, I had been thinking about going back to writing a blog. I tried to self-host the old implementation, but it was pretty much outdated and needed to be rewritten. After not so careful consideration, I ended up choosing Hugo with GitHub hosting. I plan on migrating it to my home server but IT security is not as easy as it might seem.

So, now what? Well, my idea is to post daily but I find this goal a bit unreachable. So I'm willing to commit to at least one post per week. I have many ideas about subjects to cover and series of various topics to tackle but we'll see. I don't want this blog turning into a chore rather than a hobby so as Doris Day sang: Que sera, sera. Whatever will be, will be. So yes, now I can defently shout again to people: This is so going in my blog!
