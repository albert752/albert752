      <p>So my blog is back. I started this project in March 2020 during the lockdown as a fun way to learn a bit about Django, python’s web app framework, and AWS (Amazon Web Services). I had some prior experience using Django from my first internship at NTT. If you are someone who has an interest in diving into this framework, I would strongly recommend CoreyMS <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> video series on YouTube about it. It covers the basics needed, provided you have a good understanding of the python programming language.</p>

<p>Then, time went by and I left the project with only three posts (shame on me). Also, a year after, the AWS Free tier plan that I was using expired. So, after two painful +30€ bills, I decided to shut it down. I kept renewing the domain though just in case. Fun fact, I did use the running implementation of the old blog as the deliverable for a masters’ degree subject. In teams, we had to develop a web app with security by design. So not wanting to socialize with the rest of my mates (long story short, two of them are now coworkers of mine and we get along pretty well), I asked the professor if it would be ok to use my blog as the deliverable. She said no problem and hey, it was graded with the maximum score so, not bad at all.</p>

<p>Lately, I had been thinking about going back to writing a blog. I tried to self-host the old implementation, but it was pretty much outdated and needed to be rewritten. After not so careful consideration, I ended up choosing Hugo with GitHub hosting. I plan on migrating it to my home server but IT security is not as easy as it might seem.</p>

<p>So, now what? Well, my idea is to post daily but I find this goal a bit unreachable. So I’m willing to commit to at least one post per week. I have many ideas about subjects to cover and series of various topics to tackle but we’ll see. I don’t want this blog turning into a chore rather than a hobby so as Doris Day sang: Que sera, sera. Whatever will be, will be. So yes, now I can defently shout again to people: This is so going in my blog!</p>

      <div class="content-secondary"><p>So, the blog is back. If you are new here, let me introduce myself (not that I have an entire page devoted to myself here 😉). As you may have guessed, I’m called Albert Azemar i Rovira, and I’m the proud owner of this corner of the internet. This blog is, more or less, a little fun personal, and experimental project that I’ve been on and off since 2020. Now you’ll find a mashup of ideas, hobbies, experiences, reviews, and other content I feel might be insightful or that I enjoy writing about. But it wasn’t always like this. The blog is in its second (and hopefully final) reboot. As I said, albertazemar.com started amid the COVID-19 pandemic as a sort of Proof-of-Concept of the Django framework (the Python one), and it evolved into my personal blog. At that time, I did not post a lot, to be honest, and I soon received hefty AWS bills that I was not willing to pay. So, it went dark. I kept the domain just for the sake of it. Later, in 2022, I made the second attempt to stick to the habit (the inaugural post <a href="albertazemar.com/hello-world-again/">here</a>), but it also failed. I posted more content than in the first wave, or so I remember, but I felt blogging was more of an obligation rather than an activity I enjoyed.</p>

      <div class="content-secondary"><p>People that have known me since I was an undergrad know that from 2015 to 2019, I was an active Magic The Gathering (MTG) player. For the uninitiated, MTG is a trading card game invented by Richard Garfield in the 90s. Each player must build a deck with a minimum of 60 cards with a maximum of 4 copies of the same card. These can be chosen from a pool of thousands. Then, you level yourself against an opponent to the best of three. Each week, I would take part in the Friday Night Magic (FNM) tournaments of my local games store. I never became a master or anything close, but I loved playing the game. My peak performance was achieving 16th place in a national pauper event with a meme deck. In any case, I met some tremendous people there, and the game made me escape reality for a couple of hours.</p>

      <div class="content-secondary"><p>Francis Albert Sinatra or as commonly known as Frank Sinatra is, in my humble opinion, one of the best crooners that ever lived. His songs have healed my soul when I needed it the most, guided me while dealing with my feelings, and empowered me to make bold decisions in my life. Even though we never shared a time frame in our existence, I have to thank him for always being there for me.</p>

Well, I’ve just landed at Bilbao Airport. I’m having a bit of a headache, probably caused by sleep deprivation or caffeine withdrawal. So ordering a double expresso seemed to be the obvious solution. Little did I know that I would be greeted with an overpriced coffee soup worthy to be served at Central Perk.</p>
